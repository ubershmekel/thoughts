# Windows/Linux to mac

These are the important things I'm finding useful and don't want to forget

## Keyboard shortcuts

* Ctrl-space = change language
* Ctrl-apple-space = emoji keyboard 👍🏻
* fn-delete = backspace
* fn-left / fn-right (also apple arrow) = home/end
* option-left / option-right = skip words

## UX

* Double click the title bar is kind of like windows `maximize`.
